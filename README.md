# Roll Combinations
A tool created for my company to aid in the creation of orders from various rolls.

## üìñ Overview
A group is made up of a combination of unique rolls, and groups are constrained by a minimum and maximum overall length, as well as a maximum number of rolls that can be used to make them up.

From these groups, orders can be made. The only explicit limitations on orders are a minimum/maximum on their overall width. Because of the restrictions on groups, there will also be limits on how many groups/rolls will make up a valid order.

- selenium
- Google Calendar RESTful API

## üî® Build Instructions
After forking and cloning, navigate to the repository in your command line, enter a python virtual environment, install the python libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you do not have a copy of your Google Calendar API credentials, visit [developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials) and follow the instructions.
Add credentials.json to the project folder.
Run the following script in your command line:
```
python importer.py
```
You will be prompted to authorize the app to connect to your Google Calendar

## üîÑ Adding Recurring Events
The repository comes with a bundle of recurring events already, within [recurring.json](/recurring.json). Most of these events are Trivia and Bingo Nights. The file is an array of JSON objects, each pertaining to a different venue. If the venue is already present, skip to the next section. Otherwise, you will need to add a new JSON object to the array. Each JSON object requires 3 key-value pairs:
- `venue name`: _string_, the name of the venue, which will also be the name of the sub-calendar its events go on
- `location`:   _string_, the location of the event, copied from a Google Maps entry
- `events`:     _array_,  event JSON object(s) with the requirements listed in the next section


To add an event to an existing venue, locate the venue's `events` array. Add a JSON object element with the following requirements:
- `summary`:     _string_,      title of the event
- `description`: _string_,      description of the event
- `start`:      _JSON object_, start information of the event with the following requirements
  - `dateTime`: _string_, the date/time that the event starts, formatted according to [RFC3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339)
  - `timeZone`: _string_, the time zone the event takes place in, formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. America/Denver for these events
- `end`:      _JSON object_, end information of the event with the following requirements
  - `dateTime`: _string_, the date/time that the event ends, formatted according to [RFC3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339)
  - `timeZone`: _string_, the time zone the event takes place in, formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. America/Denver for these events
